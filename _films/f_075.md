A love letter to working class solidarity. It’s amazing how much Kaurismaki can do with so little: two incredibly compelling leads, great writing, beautiful camera movement / lighting and Helsinki’s copious dreary natural resources. Less creative directors would turn this material into a kitchen sink drama but Kaurismaki makes this so funny and uplifting (in a Finnish way).

I love that the bingo hall scene here is the mirror opposite of the porno theater scene in Taxi Driver.
