“Hey Charlie, attempt to be cool.”

**The definitive motel and convenience store movie.** Keep an eye out during the Nelson scene for A) a confederate soldier B) a Busch beer advertisement covered by a Jesus Saves plaque and C) a “Wine em, Dine em, 69 em” baseball cap. 

Lord, that Liotta performance.
