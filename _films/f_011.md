Mean as you can be without ever feeling sadistic due to strong writing and steady tone. The corruption and vulnerability feel very plausible. 

The structure is incredibly lean, tossing you into the thresher by minute ten and rarely stepping off the gas afterwards. Many stunning shots, whip pan stunts and iconic action sequences that feel influential to subsequent english language genre film makers. 

Yuen Biao gives the perfect, restrained performance that the film needs and Pat Ha absolutely explodes on screen. Such a strange and completely successful dynamic.
