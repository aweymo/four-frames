“Yesterday I was looking for a thread. Today I’m looking for a piece of string.”

A great noir that dovetails into profound anthropocene cosmic horror. There is so much creativity poured into every shot, the cast is made up of a murderer’s row of incredible faces and shot on location in LA’s Bunker Hill neighborhood, soon lost to urban renewal. 

Obviously a major influence on future directors regarding genre hopping but most of all in its incredible sound design, which implements completely surreal and transfixing loops and sound beds. The film ultimately turns into something greater than the sum of these parts, becoming an aerial psychic snapshot of LA nuclear paranoia and sprawling institutional corruption.
