A Friz Freleng / Technicolor / German Expressionist daydream. I’m amazed that this was considered a failure when it was released. This feels like such a perfect live action adaptation of Dr. Seuss in look, writing and tone, the set design, lighting and cinematography are incredible and the performances are all pretty charming. It kind of reminds me of *Hellzapoppin’* as a major American comedy that is so aesthetically precise and unique in tone that it feels like it came from another, more interesting, dimension.
