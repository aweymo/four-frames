Incredible that this movie was made in the same year as Frankenheimer’s *Seconds*. The conceptual overlap, anxiety around science, interest in post WWII rebirth, surreal visual wizardry and philosophical conclusions happening in tandem an ocean away from one another is something else.

The sister/brother subplot surfaced so infrequently that it feels like a dream one of the main characters might be having, possibly the wife of the psychologist, which would explain the door opening in the office with the sister’s hair underwater? Or maybe the main plot line is the sister’s daydream, as everything that happens to her is very grounded, i.e. deeply depressing.

Hall of fame manual focus camera work.
