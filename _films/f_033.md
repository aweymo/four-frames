For a film sold on an exploitation premise, this is incredibly grounded, realistic and heavy. More *Straight Time* than *Blind Fury*. Seriously great writing, stem-winding structure, bluntly effective action and some beautiful location shooting when the film moves to Mexico. 

All of the characters are so well rendered for a genre film, in particular the wife and romantic interest, who both have real depth. I don’t think I’ve ever seen something like the post-coming home party scene and Haynes' portrayal of a wandering heart who keeps getting burned was so lived in and recognizable. Devane and Jones both portray PTSD in an understated way, quietly drawing you in as they wind up to explode.
