Italian Bond Batman doesn’t work for the government, understands the moral kinship of organized crime and the criminal justice system and has a pretty enviable monogamous relationship with his girlfriend he lives with in a designer cave who helps him do crimes.

Weirdly intrigued by British character actor Terry-Thomas here.  

Incredible that Morricone composed the music for this and *The Great Silence* in the same year. One of the most harrowing, nihilistic westerns with both feet planted in the nasty real world and absolute surreal, comic pulp — and they are both perfectly tailored, essential elements in either film.
