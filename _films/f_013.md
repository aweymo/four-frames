A *Weird Tales* interpretation of post-war Austria, teeming with memories of violence that would eventually shape itself into fascism eight years after this film was made. 

The horror is focused almost completely on sexual violence, something usually ignored in wartime cinema, and the supernatural/satanist elements allow the film to explore the subject in really interesting ways. Women are trapped in time by their abusers, frozen in an art deco castle built from war profiteering and revived only intermittently by an angular Karloff in a smoking jacket, bringing to mind a handful of recent ghouls.

All-timer Bela Legosi and Boris Karloff performances that feel like two battling monsters both traumatized by their experience. Legosi’s monster is certainly the protagonist — but the guy still sniffs a sleeping woman’s hair and flays a dude. The two Americans are arbitrary audience proxies that give hilariously oblivious performances.
