Considering they both came out in the same year, there are some major overlaps between this and *Vanishing Point*. Beyond the desert car chase premise (swapping Nevada for Portugal), they are both pretty dang nihilist meditations about men choosing to end their lives on the road, unable to find meaning after escaping their past lives. 

Like *Vanishing Point*, this also works best when it's setting up the pins, with a great first half that’s kind of anxious and beautiful and a conclusion that feels pretty rushed and unsatisfying. Also, the only women in the movie are either sex workers, used for sex or George C. Scott’s wife who left him for sex after their kid died, so there’s that, too. Pretty scenery with some grim underpinnings concerning mortality and free will that must have been floating around in the ether —
