One of the most inventive and kinetic things I’ve ever seen. More skeletons than a Fleischer Brothers cartoon. Painstaking hand drawn visual effects and stop motion techniques interspersed with ravenous camera movements that chew on the candy box technicolor palette from every angle. Maybe the fastest paced movie I’ve ever seen while still making sense and carrying a storyline throughout, which is a feat because that narrative reads like a realized daydream.
