Corny narration but otherwise amazing document of the totally insular and unique Long Beach drag racing subculture. Blank is listed as cinematographer but I am pretty sure he functioned as the guy who shot all of the B roll because so much of it has his roving quality; zooming in on interesting faces, getting distracted by strange stamp collectors, wandering away from lead characters to follow odd interactions, weird kids, etc.

Very happy to read that The Iceman lived an extremely long life and passed away last year, especially considering that DIY asbestos racing suit.
