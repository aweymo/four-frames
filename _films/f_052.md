A pocket-sized *Weird Tales* about being buried under the weight of your own compounding lies. Crawford, Cheney and Kerry fully commit to the sideshow pulp that Browning would expand on and perfect in *Freaks*. Some actors might be daunted by a scene where you blackmail a doctor into cutting your arms off but Cheney just tucked a napkin into his shirt, grabbed a knife and fork and got to work.
