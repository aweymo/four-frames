Impossibly candid and cinematic snapshot of Puerto Rican Williamsburg in the early eighties. For a director who only has two credits, Echeverria feels like they have a natural sense where they need to put a camera, which elements give a viewer a sense of character through action and must have had incredible social skills that allowed him to get right up in stranger's faces on the street and into his subject’s domestic spheres. Echeverria’s choice in subjects also provides a balanced sense of place, transitioning from criminal, maternal, religious, working and communal lenses. The speech towards the end, delivered over fire truck speakers to anonymous listeners in nearby apartment buildings was fucking crackling.
