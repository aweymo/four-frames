The elements that Tourneur sets up in this are really great. An American and a British brother, representing twin colonial forces, who own a sugar plantation on an island founded on slavery. A mother who is both puppetting and puppetted by local religious practices. A setting haunted by intense racial violence in recent memory, which the American brother copes with through alcohol and the British through sociopathic abuse. 

That said, the structure doesn’t allow the film to fully explore these themes. Tourneur spends the majority of the movie arranging chess pieces before rushing through all of the great voodoo imagery, the reveal and a couple of occult murders before screeching to a halt. It feels a little clipped, like there is something much darker and more intense that the film wants to draw out of the material but the producer slapped a bow on it at 70 minutes.
