Pabst recreates the workplace / abattoir horror of the mining industry perfectly with claustrophobic stunts and pinhole lighting that feels proto-goth. Panning shots across mining spaces feels like abstract dioramas of wooden scaffolding and smoldering coal. 

I disagree that the film is heavy handed in its message, with a beautifully written bilingual conclusion, a powerfully understated closing sequence and naturally written and performed characters that are allowed to exist outside of the event. 

The only distracting thing for me was wanting to learn everything about Germanyâ€™s apparent system for storing work clothes on bizarre vertical pulley systems.
