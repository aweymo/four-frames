Tourneur made 99% of the right decisions in a period of American history that Hollywood nearly always gets wrong (the 1% being the use of the Uncle Remus voice during the will reading speech). All of the characters are beautifully developed, the traveling circus scene belongs in a museum and so perfectly captures the feeling of a fever dream and an ominous harbinger of things to come. The story of disease in a small town has to be the most underrepresented narrative in popular culture, considering so many people lived through it who saw this film in 1949. 

Seeing it now, the depiction of racist mob violence as a reaction to uncertainty and illness still connects viscerally, and the visual dynamics Tourneur adds levels to the storytelling. There are repeated scenes within scenes where portentous smoke and fire occupy the background in contrast to the scene’s narrative, beautiful uses of spinning objects to denote montage and the passage of time in the town, and I can’t recall any director who gets their camera so close to the klan you can almost make out their bleached out brands in their potato sacks.
