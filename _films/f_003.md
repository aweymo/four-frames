So much funnier, more kinetic and visually stunning than I expected. A little thematically similar to *The Train* in showcasing the petty violence laid bare outside the obfuscating chaos of war, but also about an entire town celebrating the end of the war and grieving their loss over the course of one long night and early morning.

Perfectly captures the delusion and self mythologizing of people trying to impose a narrative on their new, post war reality. Sometimes this leads to a quaking, PTSD reckoning in the case of the main character, but more generally resulting in a communal doddering, drunken mess. 

Most accurate after party ever captured on film.
