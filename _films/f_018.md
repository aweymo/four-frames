Reminded me a little of Night Tide in the just slightly askew, atmospheric, sexually charged modern fairy tale. Staggeringly beautiful with some incredibly smart framing â€” love the shot with the two romantic leads alongside the monkeys in the pet store and the t-ruler exorcism. Officially entered into the [Pools is Creepy](https://boxd.it/l2tz4) cinematic cannon.
