Necessarily difficult viewing but equally beautiful, candid, empathetic and embedded. There are so many minute details that Farrokhzad captures which convey a unique sense of how time passed in the colony. Feels like a gift to have such a stigmatized, under documented community captured so beautifully here, and truly a shame the director didnâ€™t have the opportunity to make more work afterwards.
