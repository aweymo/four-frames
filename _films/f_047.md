Impossible to be objective with this one as a movie where George C. Scott collaborates with the supernatural to indict a Pacific Northwest robber baron’s seventy year old crime using microfiche machines and sanborn maps couldn’t be more my thing. That said, there are some really great shots, good sound design and Scott excels as a grieving father tapping into the older, deeper grief around him. 

Very funny to see the basement of the UW library rebranded as a **Psychic Research** ward. Less of a hotbed of paranormal study than good old fashion academic gate keeping, in my experience.
