Easily my favorite of the trilogy. Beautifully shot, great sound design and a totally absorbing pace and structure. Volonté’s rheumy villain, Cleef and Eastwood’s chess game relationship, Morricone absolutely going for it (“**Straight To Hell!**”), Kinski emoting so hard you think he's going to break a camera lens, purple sunsets and pink daybreaks over blasted stucco ruins. A truly epic final third that feels like Leone stumbling upon something profound, which he would try to recreate in future films in more baroque and maudlin ways. 

Also, a great montage sequence when Lee Van Cleef essentially goes to the library.
