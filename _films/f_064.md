Visually stunning, kinetically paced, disarmingly sweet and humanist. Audibly wowed at the first powdery blood spray; expressionist squibs that perfectly telegraph the heightened tone. Almost everything in the film billows, either in the foreground or background: blood, breath, smoke, drapery, clouds. It has that kind of rare, dreamy, omniscient style of camera movement that meshes perfectly with the film’s mythic structure. I love all of the friends and their minimal but effective characterizations, but Josie Ho’s performance here is stunning. An incredibly ambitious concept that feels perfectly realized.
