The stronger of the two possibly just because you have a better sense of the swath of characters at this point and To can focus more on dynamic set pieces than character building. Both endings are phenomenal but this one is just profound in the weight of it; power as a curse. The sense of unease cinematographer Siu-Keung is able to impart throughout the film in those periodic distant shots is so striking and agoraphobic. 

Hands down, the most incredible magic trick of this series is realizing that no one uses a gun throughout either film. People <i>pull</i> a gun on a boat at one point but then the method they use to kill is much, much worse! The baton is the one physical object that makes the myth of honor and tradition a shared reality amongst the triad and ends with crudely thudding blunt forces determining the overarching political sea change. This film eats The Godfatherâ€™s lunch.
