Subversive minimalism not only in plot mechanics but also backstory. Aside from one of the characters waggling eyebrows at the thought of going into a strip club in the beginning, these two male characters feel effectively like they are traveling together to do something in secret, which adds layers to the hostage situation and the following multinational manhunt. 

Beautifully shot by Tourneur cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca, never feeling repetitive despite spending a large amount of the time in the same confined space. On top of that, Lupinoâ€™s script was also distinct from male counterparts in noire for being set in Mexico yet somehow refraining from stock, offensive stereotypes. So, one up on, say, Orson Welles.
