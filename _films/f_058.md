Still Kaurismaki bleak-core but a little less tethered to reality in subtle and fun ways: 

- The mother character seemingly works 24 hours a day at every crappy job in Finland.

- The key to breaking out of Finnish prisons is just having a pipe to hit the guard over the head.

- Absolute style icon Matti Pelonpaa with a green turtleneck and a giant sledgehammer, which he should have been allowed to drag through every scene in the second half of the film.
