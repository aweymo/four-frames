Considering it’s a period piece, this is an incredibly modern portrait of a serial killer, with composer Bernard Herrman, cinematographer Joseph LaShell and lead Laird Cregar all pitched up to ten but still somehow working in perfect harmony. 

Cregar flawlessly balances:

- immediately revealing himself as a murderer who voluntarily hands himself over to authority 

- being a complete human being, poorly navigating life and business 

- maybe putting on the whole amnesia bit to disassociate from his crimes and handing himself to authority as either a cry for help or a taunt. 

If Faye Marlow’s character knows about the serial killing, which there’s just the faintest indication, this movie is D A R K.

The most British moment in cinema history occurs when a boy gets a schilling donation from Laird to pay for his Guy Fawkes effigy doll and says, “He’s a bit of alright!”
