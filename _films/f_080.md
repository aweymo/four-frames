The first third made me think I was in for the typical 70’s New Hollywood feel-bad, when the movie tore off the road and pulled my pants down on the interstate and tore into an ethical sandbox that eighties directors would build off of.

My favorite Hoffman performance (almost a little unrecognizable here), hands down my favorite Busey and one of my favorite Stanton supporting roles. That entire Harry Dean Stanton pool scene is absolute gold. No one can sell double fisting a cigarette and a burger like ‘em.

Beautiful LA location work, too.
