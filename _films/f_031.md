Precision pulp. The lead character is the least compelling, with Sid Haig, Beverly Washburn and a fleet of amazing non-actors transporting you into the late sixties California racing culture. Jack Hill implements a world of technical language and flippantly introduces and excises side characters in a way that drops you into the film's ecosystem and requires you to keep up in a way that feels slightly proto-Mann.

Important note: if the drag racing arenas count as junk yards (and they should on a technicality) this is nearly a 100% junk yard movie.
