Pretty phenomenal thriller subversion with incredibly solid work from Gunn and Berenson and an all-timer, weirdo hall of fame performance from Geraldine Chaplin. Alan Rudolf’s script is kind of perfect in what it doesn’t explain — characters rehearse their stories, perform for others and react in volatility when things go off script — but the backstory is never really revealed, which adds a cryptic charge to the whole thing. 

The film feels bound together by Tak Fujimoto’s cinematography, who documents a dusty, industrial, working class moment in LA beautifully. Reminded a little of Straight Time as another tense, character based thriller from 78 that tears away from the fabric of New Hollywood social drama into something more strange, kinetic and dynamic.
