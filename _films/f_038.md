The first widely released American experimental film, produced for ninety seven dollars entirely in the directorâ€™s kitchens, living rooms and garages just to take the piss out of Hollywood. Beautiful miniatures, great lighting and genuinely funny. The shot of the mindlessly yapping film bros in the audience is truly timeless.
