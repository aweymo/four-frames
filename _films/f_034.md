For a film often remembered as an Amblin-era concession, this felt like a complete triumph. Carpenter was able to adapt and improve on the gauzy aesthetic and popcorn structure while replacing the melodrama stuffing with a disarmingly sincere study on love and grief. Absolute all-timer performance by Karen Allen from beginning to end.

Also, the half drunk letter jacket guy that decides to knock on Starmanâ€™s hotel room door to tell him the cops are messing with the car, then creates a diversion by throwing a vending machine down a stairwell? One of cinema's great protagonists.
