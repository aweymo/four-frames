Similar to *A Face in the Crowd*, which came out five years earlier, in defying popular depictions of race-baiting as a function of capitalism rather than a billowing ethical cloud to hurl sticks at. 

While that film only hints at the racism of Griffith's southern demagogue, you have to hand it to Corman for just how many fucking punches he pulls for a 1962 release. Racists speak like racists, including Shatner's town hall steps hate speech, which feels so contemporary its amazing people still lace up their dancing shoes for that *exact* same patter. 

Leo Gordon stole the show for me. He looks like an R. Crumb drawing and his performance was completely unique and compelling. Corman uses him in subtle and clever ways: a sex deviant in the beginning who becomes the only clear thinking person by the end; Shatner's salesman reflection who defeats him through his own crippling narcissism/inferiority complex. 

That said, I did want a little more from the ending. Give me one last scene after the playground with Shatner in the next town over hitting the pavements with some more *Good News*.
