Thinking about Robert Siodmak co-directing with Edgar G. Ulmar in *People On Sunday* in Germany years earlier and both of them producing two weirdly prescient films set in locked houses later in their careers. For Ulmar, *The Black Cat* predicts the rise of fascism more clearly and poetically than any film Iâ€™ve ever seen and here Siodmak creates the film language for the slasher using a villain grasping at the fumes of fascistic and eugenic concepts. 

Some beautiful shots, fun character dynamics and I thought the Ethel Barrymore dementia / soothsayer element was really well acted and written. A woman whose intuition has always been sharp but becomes marginalized and discredited through affliction, which feels like the overarching theme.
