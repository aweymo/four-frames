More compositional, dreamy surrealism than a series of chaotic, Dadaist set pieces. Not going to deny the sexual element to the pearl as the driving force of the film but the overall concept is rewardingly deep, murky and steeped in early twentieth century psychology (and maybe drugs). If I were to take a stab at it: it’s the male lead’s perceptions of his competing love interests, existing in stasis in the park or as multiple people, slinking around hotel rooms in fun bodysuits looking for coin, with the young woman in a nightgown acting as his nagging conscience. Some dreamy tracking shots, artful editing and beautiful framing. Underseen standout from the movement.
