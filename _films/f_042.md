A noir charmer that achieves all the modest goals it sets out to do. McGraw seems like a guy who probably got typecast as a one dimensional cop (extreme proto-Michael Madsen vibes) but he has great chemistry with White, who is also really winning here. There are some excellent shots, including an innovative, wheezy close-quarters fight sequence. The reveal doesnâ€™t *really* make sense but by that point I was pretty well won over by this breezy cat and mouse on a choo choo.
