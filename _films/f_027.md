An engaging pulp novel tone and structure paired with very strong cinematography that captures the on-location, mildewy patina beautifully. The lead is smartly written and acted extremely well by Jacki Karin, who only has this single feature credit. Some very dynamic and creative shots for what looks like a moderately budgeted horror, including a hell of a final one-shot sequence. Sure there’s some *Shining* homages but I kept being reminded of the original *Black Christmas* with the smart horror protagonist, the varying degrees of dumb dudes, narrative misdirects and the structure of the house being intrinsic to the danger.

Rewatch thoughts: this thing is packed with weird visual rhymes (the eye drops to rain, the nudie pen when asked about an evening, magnifying glass and the sculpture with an eye busted out) and ideas that are subtly set up and paid off later (stacking items, keys and eyes). So when I rewatched the scene in the attic, I wondered why they never pay off the loose wiring, water observation -- but they totally do. It's teased at in the final scene with the loose wiring and gasoline after the crash and it’s almost like the protagonist is speaking to the screenwriter directly and saying "let's not over-complicate this thing when I have a goddam shotgun in my hands." It's such a funny, writerly beat that doesn’t detract from the momentum at all.
