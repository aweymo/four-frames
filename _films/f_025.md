**A traditional heist movie** but the score is a child murderer, the team is a criminal syndicate and the cinematic template for a heist movie wont actually be established for another twenty years. Innovative cinematography, completely modern editing techniques and a subversive criminal vs. justice dynamic with a few totally stunning sequences:

- After the abduction > through the stairwell > watching the laundry in the attic > seeing the balloon slip through the electrical lines

- The omniscient camera roaming around and surveying the damage of the office building, down into the hole in the floor

- The cutlery window display > hypnotic, animated window display > cafe in the bushes, where Lorre comes down off the homicidal urge like a cognac drinking animal 

- This also felt like one of the earliest examples of a director establishing trenchant, shorthand character development for minor figures on both sides of the law (watch setting, card tricks, the police officer heckled by the speakeasy crowd)

While these elements feel almost out of time in their innovation and influence, the final stretch is hobbled by overly an long, semi-comedic kangaroo court sequence followed by a strangely clipped, moralistic honk. To my mind, there is a blunt, poetic ending that is more fitting, where justice isnâ€™t delivered by either the criminals or the justice system that was maybe a little too dark?
