The horror of toxic short guy energy. The cinematography and set design is fantastic, the Delia Derbyshire soundtrack and sound design* is phenomenal, the cast is all solid but Roddy McDowell absolutely runs away with the thing. The title card elements, experimental editing and perched perspective around the mansion all feel incredibly influential and the strange, horny elements don’t wind up feeling like exploitation but literally like an environment getting under people’s skin. This one’s absolutely joining *Black Christmas* on the yuletide horror rotation.

*It sounds like Derbyshire is running the cat noises through a BBC modular synthesizer that probably took up a full office and it’s beautifully, perfectly uncanny.
