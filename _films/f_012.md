Not a horror — a relentlessly uncomfortable philosophical comedy about religion and deciding whether to exist and operate in the real world or an imagined future. From the first scene, the film plays with how frames of reference obscure truth and often delude people who believe they claim ownership of it. 

This film hates organized religion in a way I really enjoyed / The wife’s whole thing feels strangely contemporary / The cinematography is diamond cut black and white with dramatic lighting used, more often than not, for comic effect. There are so many beautifully shot visual set pieces (gags? metaphors?) strewn throughout, like the husband covering the board of taxidermy eyes after the murder. I also appreciate that they gave the taxidermy specialist a spot on the opening credits.
