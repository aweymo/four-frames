Like watching a local television director’s alternately anxious, absurd and lamenting dream. A completely unique piece of regional American art soaked in Catholic guilt and catacombal self reflection. Ambitions are as high as the budget is low. 

Excellent double feature with other rustbelt fantasies Martin (1977) or Uptight (1968).

Rewatched this one with commentary because I found myself thinking about this one quite a bit after my initial watch. There something to the way the film is composed completely from relationships he developed in Braddock and, despite the very low budget, he utilizes the swim-y, reflective quality of eighties television production to create something that feels equally like an autobiography and a dream. It’s a premise that could be self indulgent but it’s not really about Buba, it’s a swirl of characters, memories, diversions and nagging reminders.
