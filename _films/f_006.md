Kind of reminded me of *Something Wild* in the fish out of water premise that effectively swings between character study comedy and intense, surreal violence. Less about the indigenous population than the outsider’s projections about that community, filtered through a white savior complex. 

The structure is such a smart, effective way to analyze what we might now call “allyship.” Ideological differences are quickly forgiven between the two white leads when they are alone in a vacuum with a force (possibly symbolic, maybe hallucinated) that threatens basic Western values of law and capitalism. All three leads excel in completely different ways.
