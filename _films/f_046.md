Don Siegal’s *Picnic at Hanging Rock*, a Civil War Giallo that feels heightened and novelistic but also plausible and almost remembered. The heightened tone works because *every* female cast member is giving incredibly committed performances to the pulpy material and, although I’m not a huge fan of the guy, it’s the best (and most) acting I’ve ever seen Clint do. 

A large part of the film is shot very close-in, reflecting the porous interior monologues of the characters within the schoolhouse (Mae Mercer in particular is electric in close-up). Contrast that with the few moments that the girl’s school interacts with the Civil War where students are framed sitting in tall trees or from a great distance behind a veil of spanish moss, indicating the vulnerability of their situation and the constant, low hum of possible sexual violence in the air. Siegal loves to start his films in an unsettling, morally dubious way (*The Killers, Charley Varrick*) and boy howdy does he do it here, but everything really came together about halfway through in a way I’ve never seen before. 

Feels completely original and fully realized.
