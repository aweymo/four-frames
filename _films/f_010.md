Maybe the best “wilderness” movie I’ve ever seen. I don’t understand how the thing looks this good shot in uncontrolled conditions. An incredible combination of on-location atmosphere, perfect cinematography, naturalistic acting and sleight of hand storytelling. 

While checking the boxes of socialist realism in the form of ‘self sacrifice and resilience for the greater good’, there’s a lot under the hood that feels deeply critical. All of this happened in order to find some rocks in the ground for the government and the moments of propaganda happen when the characters have basically lost their minds. 

In a film with an embarrassment of visually stunning sequences, the survivor floating down the river lying on a plank of ice on fire absolutely floored me.
