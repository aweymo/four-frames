Spoiling nothing: this is one of the best twisty, suspense mysteries Iâ€™ve ever seen. The editing, cinematography and performances are a magic trick and the last third feels like Night of the Hunter on pills. The set dressing is richly detailed with symbols of both prolonged adolescence and obsolescence occupying the backgrounds of shots, hinting at some interiority. A film not only exposing the prejudice of the characters over time but equally implicating the audience, which I love.

Also, I know what [junket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junket_(dessert)) is now.
