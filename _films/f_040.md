“Let it happen”

Incredibly well shot and acted movie about WWII vets slipping back into violence through economic depression. Very wild that this is from the guy who directed Casablanca, which is fine, but this is so much more complicated, dynamic and visually rich. Beautifully framed location work dockside in Newport Beach, California, essentially a mid-century stevedore’s perspective, floating through bungalow homes, bars and racetracks. 

For a movie about crime, it’s really striking how affecting and natural the marriage scenes are and how they charge everything else in the film. Genuinely spilt on whether the claustrophobic final shootout was more or less tense than the hair dying scene. Also, that final shot is a right hook that felt like it came out of nowhere — an absolute indictment of the audience for siding with the protagonist. Stunner!
