“Some are born to fail, others have it thrust upon them.”

Coming in with very low expectations, this is easily my favorite Walter Hill film and my favorite Charles Bronson lead performance. There were a lot of 1970s movies that were set in the 1930s and while some were immaculate (*Chinatown*), many more were sloppy (*Wise Blood*), overly theatrical (*The Fortune*) or chintzy (*Emperor of the North*). For a lower budget film, this looks really great, packed with strong, natural performances and resolves in a neat (if not particularly deep) way. More *Street Fighter* than *Street Fighter*.

The James Coburn HOOOOOOO!
