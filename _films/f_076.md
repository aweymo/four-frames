Funny, bleak, small, intermittently bloody and inventively structured western that feels very proto-Coen Brothers (who would cast Bridges and Huddleston together again 26 years later). Having the two leads both under the impression they are seamlessly pulling a long con on one another while they are constantly fucking up and being pushed farther and farther into the fray felt very realistic and dynamic. All of the trade sequences really leaned into frontier strangeness in a great way.
