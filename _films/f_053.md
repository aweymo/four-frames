I’ve had to work really late on a couple of projects so I’ve been disengaging by watching a couple quick *Ultraseven* episodes. An absolute treasure of practical effects, painstaking miniatures, drawn on film animation and imaginative set design. A little like a Japanese *Twilight Zone* in the way up and coming directors were able to cut their teeth on a few episodes before breaking out on their own. 

Episode eight *The Targeted Town* is essentially Japanese New Wave about rage inducing cigarettes shot on location in a log boom skid row with the alien baddie slumming it in a crappy apartment/aircraft base. 

One of the most visually inscrutable visual effects used in the opening sequence I've ever seen.
