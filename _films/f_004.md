“…Patriotic drunk…”

Perfectly cast, acted, shot and written indictment of American WWII opportunism and festering small town bigotry. The scenario that plays out here happened thousands of times over with private citizens and government bureaus stealing land from incarcerated Japanese Americans. I can’t imagine how raw and audacious this must have felt for audiences only a decade away from those events. A whirring Swiss watch that still feels deeply relevant.

There’s something so interesting about how Tracey holds the liquor bottle in the final hotel lobby scene, like a cudgel or a wand that he is using to break down the levee of communal silence. There’s something to this, the sheriff’s four year hangover since the killing and the molotov cocktail at the end that I haven’t completely figured out.
