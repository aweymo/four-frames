"Close the doors and they'll come in through the windows."

This one really got its hooks in me. The train sequence is a perfect example of something that shouldn't work logically or tonally but strikes a completely unique balance through sheer force of will. This is my favorite Dennis Hopper performance, perfectly utilizing his kinetic ability and ideally complimenting Ganz, who radiates calmness and complexity. 

Wenders pulls an incredible card trick with the driving force of the film, painting a nuanced portrait of someone with an illness. So often a disease is a character's only attribute and all of the misdirects here stem from that trope. Sometimes Ganz's decisions are driven by illness, sometimes just regular human boredom and his family is left to sort these decisions between resentment and understanding in a way that really resonated. 

That entire New York (?) sequence between Nicholas Ray and Hopper on the bridge leading to the 180 degrees shot of Samuel Fuller in the porno studio was monumental.
