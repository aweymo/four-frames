The most kaleidoscopic, shimmering sequence of a woman scanning documents you’ll ever see. Compact horror that swings between comic pulp and quite serious subject matter to perfect, head spinning effect. Lesser movies would make all of Carol Kane’s victims completely unsympathetic but ethics are muddy and Kane’s performance feels equally precise and unhinged, which feels like a Cindy Sherman thumbprint. Love the ghost sequence before the fire.
