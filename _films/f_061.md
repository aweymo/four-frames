A movie that I thought I'd seen but actually just watched bits and pieces of a tv edit that was playing an odd amount on Denver local television stations in the 1990s (imagine trying to make a tv edit of this thing). In retrospect, this feels very small for Lynch, who has  spent most of his career exploring unending, cosmic rot. But in Lumberton*, you can walk right over to the hospital, turn a corner, find yourself in hell and then walk right out again. Nothing that hasnâ€™t been said before here, but Rossellini is absolutely giving a God frequency performance here. Love the on location, Wilmington, North Carolina patina.

*Has there ever been a more quintessentially Pacific Northwest filmmaker that was born in Montana and spent his whole life in California?
