A B-roll goldmine of dirty 1970s Los Angeles. Kotto and Nichols are powerhouses, the script is diamond-cut neo-noir (“He’s like a bulldog with eyes up his ass”) and many of the shots feel very influential — the death sequence at the end in particular. 

Wild that the only nudity in a 1970s exploitation film about sex work is shot like a horror sequence. Missed opportunity that the poster for the film isn’t Yaphet Kotto in a hospital, stealing a kid and kicking a guy in a wheelchair over for absolutely no reason.
