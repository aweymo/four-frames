There’s kind of an odd amount of dialogue about Terry Gilliam when it comes to Zeman that I think is a little unwarranted. Zeman’s work was obviously an influence on Gilliam’s early animation but once he becomes a live action director, he doesn’t bring these incredibly painstaking approaches that require an engineer’s detail to his feature films (and I’ve got a lot of fondness for Gilliam’s Munchausen). 

Also, Gilliam’s animated collage was just one bow in Zeman’s quiver — which also included double exposure, matte painting, large scale carpentry effects, composite shots, animation interacting with live elements, looney tune timing, stop motion, puppetry, early animatronics and a very charming wide-eyed awe in the natural world at the heart of his films.

Zeman reminds me more of George Méliès, despite their stylistic differences and their careers separated by almost 50 years. Both of them were “frock coat fantasists” who realized their daydreams with DIY spirit and technical craft. Zeman would honestly make more sense as someone working in 1910 than the early 60s and some of the more modern elements towards the beginning and end do clash a little tonally — but it’s tricky business rocketing from the Ottoman Empire to Czech retro-futurism in under a minute.
