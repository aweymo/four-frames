A sequel that compliments and compounds Tourneur’s film in pretty brilliant ways. While the first film is about the alienation and loneliness of the immigrant experience in the urban environment, this explores how those different ways of interpreting the world are passed down generationally and how that uniqueness is surgically criticized in small town America.

This recreates the feeling of childhood incredibly well, where perception is sharper and more expansive than the distracted and short sighted adults you are forced to interact with. This is due to Ann Carter’s incredible child performance but also to the structure of the film, which allows for adolescent interpretations of the adult world of dementia, grief and cruelty (being a kid is so rough). I also really love how the film captures a child’s geographical footprint, with the entire film taking place in the four blocks around her house. 

Roald Dahl parents, *Night of the Hunter* dream logic and folk horror gauze set in a small town America frozen in the Victorian era. Hell of a thing. Also, a Christmas movie.
