The second Preminger movie I’ve seen which operates under the premise that women have a right to exist even if they live in the same corrupted world as everyone else. 

A legal procedural that eschews both corny moralism and corny nihilism, in which law is meant to be understood first and then moved around fluidly depending on circumstance. The master stroke of the film is that this fluidity is never a point of contention for Stewart’s protagonist or even brought up once. The courtroom is its own morally ambivalent bureaucratic  ecosystem that exists outside the personal ethical sphere.

Little Ben Gazzara and George C. Scott, two of my absolute favorite film patriarchs, serving up incredibly strong early performances here. Also, cinema’s definitive (only?) “cool judge” performance by Joseph N. Welch, who really [couldn’t have more credibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_N._Welch).
