As visually fantastic as you can imagine while still being firmly tethered to a smart horror whodunit storyline. The surreal lighting and gleeful gore of Giallo combined with beautiful shot composition and wry comic tone that reminded me a little of Hitchcock. 

That said, there are some incredibly inventive sequences that I can't imagine anyone but Bava thinking of (behind the fireplace shot! unbelievably close reverse reaction shots! the entire dang antique shop sequence!). 

Great ensemble of characters that are visually striking and loaded with pathos even if they only have four lines. Honestly, fully on board by those incredible opening credits.
