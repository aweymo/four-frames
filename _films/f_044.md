The smartest exploration of criminal diplomacy I’ve seen, perfectly structured with a visual style that feels immediately recognizable in future eastern and western genre films. Action scenes are close-in, shaky and visceral — tense moments pull far away to visualize the scale of the adversary — respites peer down from odd angles like owls and billow from electric fans. 

I love all of the on-location street scenes and jarring, microtonal musical elements of 1970 Okinawa, influenced by Western and South Asian culture through geographic distance from the mainland and military occupation. For a very cool, methodically paced film, that ending took me by surprise too.
