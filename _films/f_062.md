A clear influence on a handful of modern classics that sanitized and sanded the edges off of the source material. In the ‘young men are monsters’ pantheon along with *Martin*, but really, aside from the Scottish maintenance person, everyone in the film is pretty gross. Posters and standees are sexual avatars fetishized in lieu of the human beings behind them. *“You don’t have to do anything, just play the part.”*

Incredibly rich side characters, propulsive editing and the cobbled German/British bathhouse location is amazing. It feels like a ruin and acts as an acoustic instrument that becomes more cavernous and booming as things get increasingly dark.
