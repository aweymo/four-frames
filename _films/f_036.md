“I don’t want to walk, I want to sleep.”

Incredibly great. An absolute chameleon of a movie that picks up and puts down genres depending on where the narrative needs to go. At different points reminding me of *Repo Man*, *8 1/2* and Dassin’s *Uptight* but completely it’s own thing. 

Beautifully portrays how we can ruin our lives and the lives of others for dreams that don’t really make sense and we’ve never examined on a practical level. While the scope is large and St. John makes some bold choices, the editing and cinematography is razor sharp and the performances are grounded. For being a movie about intrusive thoughts, escapism and grieving, it’s also a movie that recognizes that our subconscious is funny; it’s floating hot dogs and wanting to be interviewed by a press mob without having anything to say.
 
Also, that cab driver scene is amazing.
