I guess Finland has always been black metal. Beautiful looking Laplander folk horror with a great score and a trim run time. 

The set pieces feel like they are from the fifties but some of those interiors look like *HÃ¤xan* or F.W. Murnau. The main takeaway: I too want to learn to paddle surf over snowy mountains.
