<p class="caption">Point No Point was named by Lieutenant Charles Wilkes of the US Exploring Expedition in May 1841 because he thought the quarter-mile-long point tended to appear and disappear from view, depending on his position. Before that the area was an Sâ€™klallam fur trading point and after that here has been the Point No Point Lighthouse. During WWII the lighthouse was used as a station for convalescing service men and movies were projected on the lighthouse's attic walls.</p>
